# StereoVision_AND_MeanShiftSegmentation

Disparity Estimation check from rectified images using basic block matching and dynamic programming. A consistency check was performed to elimate the noisy disparity estimates.

For View Synthesis : View3 is what you would see if you place a camera exactly at the midpoint of the baseline of cameras
that captured view1 and view5. The task was to generate view3 by using view1 and view5 images and their respective ground truth disparity maps.

Performing Mean Shift Segmentation for clustering of similar pixels together.
